title: 'Internet Connection'
---

Even though the main goal of this kit is to work offline in an area where no internet connection is available, you may want to connect the device to the internet from time to time.

Reasons to connect to the internet include:

* Content updates 
* Software updates
* Maintenance


Depending on the circumstances, there are several different ways to connect to the internet.

## Cybercafé

If you are close to a city and want to save money, the easiest way to get connected is a cybercafé.  The KoomBook can simply connect to a WiFi hotspot to get an upgrade, for example.  

You do not have to purchase any data or hardware for this option. 


## 3G/4G Data Connection

If available, the mobile data connection is quite handy.  You can use a mobile or fixed WiFi router to connect to the internet. Some KoomBook kits are equipped with a built-in 3G or 4G modem, so you won't have to buy a 3G/4G USB stick. In any case, the hotspot allows users to connect to the internet through WiFi. 

The portable hotspot can handle up to 10 connected users at once. The fixed router, which needs a main supply of electricity, can handle several dozen users. 

### Mobile

We have tested succesfully the [TP-LINK M5360 3G wifi router](https://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-14_M5360.html) which is a great product for the KoomBook kit. 

> > > > > Even if the KoomBook kit works in your area, check with the local internet provider to make sure the WiFi router can work as well. Sometimes, frequency or local internet configuration may not be compatible with the product. The best option is to buy locally!

If available, you can also use the 4G version : [TP-LINK M7310](https://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-4692_M7310.html)

### Fixed

The fixed version must be connected to a main power supply (110v/220v).  This version

* can handle more users at the same time
* has a larger bandwidth 
* has better WiFi coverage

Models include:
[TP-LINK TL-MR6400](https://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-4691_TL-MR6400.html) (3G/4G modem must be bought separately)

### Finding the Right Data Plan

After choosing a router, you will need to choose an internet provider. Each country has its own, with both good and bad deals. 

Here are a few things to consider when making your decision:

* Is your area covered by the local provider? 

  * Go to the area with a smartphone with a sim card from the provider to check if the coverage and connection quality are good enough for your project

* Does the provider provide limited or unlimited data transfer? 

  * Estimate how much data you need per day, per month, etc...

  * In some countries, internet providers sell an unlimited 3G/4G connection, or 50GB/month

  * In others, they only sell small vouchers of between 1GB and 10GB, which can be renewed at any time

In some countries, there also may be websites that compare providers and can help with your decision.  In France, for example, you can use this site: [https://www.choisirsonforfait.com/forfait/comparatif.php](https://www.choisirsonforfait.com/forfait/comparatif.php)

>>>>> Make sure the deal fits your needs!


### Configuring the Device

To set up the device, you will need to

* Change the admin password
* Personalize the WiFi hotspot name
* Activate the sim card

## Landline Connection

If available, the landline ADSL internet connection can be fast and reliable. However in some countries this option can be worse than the mobile connection and should be considered plan B.

## Satellite

In some cases, satellite internet is the best option as there is no other way to get a connection. 

You will have to check locally what providers are available.

For instance, in Burundi, satellite internet from [OptiLINK Ku](http://www.iec-telecom.com/product/optilink-ku/) can be used. It provides a limited Internet connection with up to 15GB of data per month.
