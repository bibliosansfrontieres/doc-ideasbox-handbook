Depending on the needs, two type of video-projector can be use.

## Light & portable

Projector with built-In Battery (~4 hours) and RGB LED light (around 250 lumens)

This type of hardware can cover basic needs for showing content for few people. 
The room must be in the darkness for a good experience

We use the [LG PH30JG](http://www.lg.com/fr/video/lg-PH30JG-videoprojecteur)
