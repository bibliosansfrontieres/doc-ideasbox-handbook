title: 'Computing Basics'
---

## Intro

Humility: One cannot know everything.  The idea is not to know everything, but to understand the basics to be able to search for information.

Ask everyone to describe their level: who has already used a computer? a usb drive? the internet?
* Who has set up a computer using windows?


## Computer Introduction:

* Help people understand that it is a collection of components and devices, screen, keyboard, mouse, power.  The difference between fixed and portable, show them the server and its different interfaces.
* Show a USB plug, a VGA connector, a network cable, a power block 
* Explain what the computer contains: motherboard, hard drive, RAM, etc...

## Explain the Difference Between OS and Applications

* Ask them: Name some applications (one app each if everyone is familiar with the computer.  Otherwise, do not push beginners in a public setting!).

  * Possible Responses: Office, Firefox, ... word processors, internet browsers, video games, etc...  

* Question: What are the Operating Systems that you know?

  * Response: Add the others that they don't know (Android, freebsd, etc...).  The tablets are computers with an Android operating system.

* Question: What versions of Windows do you know?


## Explain What Files Are

An application is a file, just one that you can execute or run.

Certain files can be opened with applications included with the operating system, but others need a specific application to be opened.

Show and explain the different file extensions: .txt, .doc, .docx, .avi

## Explain the Difference Between Kilobytes, Megabytes, and Gigabytes  

MB = Megabyte

1024 KB = 1 MB, 1024 MB = 1GB, 1024 GB = 1TB

>>>>Do not confuse MB (Megabytes) and Mb (megabits).  In the majority of systems, a Megabyte is composed of 8 bits, which means that 1MB=8Mb.

Internet speed is given in Megabits and can be divided by 8 to determine the speed in Megabytes.


### Exercises:

* Q : I have a connection at 256 kbits/s and I want to download a 20 MB video.  How much time will it take?
  * R : 256/8 = 32 KB/s or 32 s to download 1 MB. It will thus take me: 32 x 20 = 640 seconds to download the file, or 10 minutes and 40 seconds.

Talk about file systems: FAT32, NTFS, extfs, etc...

How many 3 MB files can I put on a 2 GB USB drive?  On a 1 TB external drive?


## Storage Devices

Talk about the need for backups, by underlining the fragility of hard drives because of the speed of their roation.  Explain the difference between magnetic storage (memory card, USB drive, etc.) and storage decks (hard drive made up of several turntables).

## Networks

Explain the logic of the client-server relationship.  Explain that the internet is a gigantic network, on a global scale, but also a network where clients ask questions of servers using protocols.

Talk about IP: what is an address, what is a subnet mask, what is a bridge?  Bring up Fixed IPs and DHCP.

Talk about WiFi vs. ethernet, satellite vs. fiber, 2G vs. 3G.  All are a way to connect to a network, regardless of the method and tools used.

## Conclusion and Things to Remember

You can find information on Wikipedia, or on forums.  

There is no such thing as a stupid question.  

The wise are those who do not know the answer, but know how to find it.  

Working together is essential.  

We all started somewhere.  

Often another point of view or another style of working is the key to solving a problem.
