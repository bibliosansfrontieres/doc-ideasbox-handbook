## Capacity and autonomy 

The tank has a capacity of 4.2 L of gasoline.

The autonomy is approximately 4.7 hours.

## Prerequisite

The first time the generator is used, it will need to be filled without

* **Oil** : 0.4 L of SAE 10W30 type oil
* **Gazoline** : 4.2L unleaded gasoline

> > > Get a funnel to fill the oil and fuel tanks 



> > > > Using the funnel, fill the oil tank first and then the fuel tank. If there are any leftovers, it is better to have oil in the gasoline rather than the other way around.


## Putting the device into operation

### Hardware 

![20181023_112415](20181023_112415.jpg)

* 1 x 10-15L gasoline canister
* 1 oil tank of 1 to 2 L, SAE 4 stroke 10W30
* Rags
* The user manual
* The generator set


### Topping up the oil

1. Open the oil level hatch

   ![20181023_112523](20181023_112523.jpg)
   
2. Remove the filler cap and visually check the oil level, the oil should be flush with the filler neck.

   ![20181023_113155](20181023_113155.jpg)

3. If necessary, top up to the level required. 

4. Close cap and hatch

### Filling up the gas tank

1. Visually check the fuel level on the fuel gauge next to the large fuel filler cap. 
   ![20181023_114532](20181023_114532.jpg)
   1. If the level is close to F "Full" the tank is almost full. 
   2. If the level is close to E "Empty" the tank is almost empty.
2. If necessary, fill up to the letter "F" or to the maximum level of the sieve filter
