##Â The charger doesn't charge the battery
- First, make sure that the charger has a power supply.
- If it is connected to the power supply, verify the connections between the charger and the exterior IEC plug of the yellow module.
- Check the voltage with a voltmeter.  If it is at 0, verify the connection between the terminals of the charger and the battery.
- Make sure the terminals are in good shape (unscrew the bolts, sandpaper the connectors and the copper plate, unscrew and reconnect the connectors between the charger and the battery)
-  If it still doesn't work, take out the battery and recharge it with a current charger (automobile type)
-  If it turns out that the battery can't be recharged, replace it with a model available in your area (12 V, 160 Ah, ideally a gel battery, but other models will do the job for a short time).
-  If the battery can recharge, recharge it quickly to avoid significant loss of battery.
