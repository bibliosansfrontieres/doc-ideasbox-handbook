title: 'Server Installation and Configuration'
---

The server’s installation is automated by running a tool called Ansible. We use this tool in order to install and automatically configure all the components necessary for the server’s proper use. A description of the tasks to be completed is available on [GitHub](http://ansiblecube.doc.bibliosansfrontieres.org).
