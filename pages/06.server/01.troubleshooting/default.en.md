title: 'Troubleshooting the Server'

##The server doesn't turn on
**Symptom**: the server doesn't turn on when you press the button 
- Verify that the power cord is correctly plugged in.  Unplug it and plug it back in.
- Verify the battery is charged.
- Try with the power block (supplied with the server) plugged into the 220 V main power.
- If it still doesn't work, the server is defective, and needs to be returned to the manufacturer for repairs.  Contact BSF headquarters. 

## The charger doesn't charge the battery
- First, make sure that the charger has a power supply.
- If it is connected to the power supply, verify the connections between the charger and the exterior IEC plug of the yellow module.
- Check the voltage with a voltmeter.  If it is at 0, verify the connection between the terminals of the charger and the battery.
- Make sure the terminals are in good shape (unscrew the bolts, sandpaper the connectors and the copper plate, unscrew and reconnect the connectors between the charger and the battery)
-  If it still doesn't work, take out the battery and recharge it with a current charger (automobile type)
-  If it turns out that the battery can't be recharged, replace it with a model available in your area (12 V, 160 Ah, ideally a gel battery, but other models will do the job for a short time).
-  If the battery can recharge, recharge it quickly to avoid significant loss of battery.

## The Ideas Box Hotspot Doesn't Show Up
- Connect a screen to the server (a video projector would also work), and verify that the graphical interface is working.
- Restart the server and check if the hotspot has appeared after several minutes.
- Contact Bibliothèques Sans Frontière for remote assitance.

## I Forgot the Admin Password

* Attach a keyboard, mouse, and screen to the server to access the graphical interface
* Once the screen is connected, use the login name **ideascube** and the password that BSF sent you
* Once connected, click on the icon menu at the lower left and select **System Tools > LXTerminal**
* In LXTerminal, type```ideascube changepassword admin``` (```admin``` can be replaced with another username to change their password).
