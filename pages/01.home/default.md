**The Koombook kit has been designed to serve isolated communities in challenging environments. Its autonomy, robustness and mobility enable deployment in most locations affected by a crisis**
* Can be set up in any environment, indoor or outdoor

* Can be part of a mobile unit in outreach programs, where a team of facilitators could use the Koombook kit to provide access to information to remote or isolated communities

* Can be set up in a fixed location that is easily accessible by the community (library, community center, supplies distribution spot, parkâ€¦). Handled by a volunteer or staff facilitator it provides access to information and creates a social hub

* Each kit is currently able to connect 10 people at a time. Tests will be run to prototype a kit with broader range, potentially up to 50 simultaneous users.

* The Koombook kit has been designed to resist high temperature and dust.
