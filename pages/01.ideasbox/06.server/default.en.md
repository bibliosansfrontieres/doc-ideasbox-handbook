title: 'Installation and configuration of the server'
---

The server’s installation is automated through a running tool called Ansible. We use this tool in order to install and configure automatically all the components necessary for the server’s proper use. A description of the tasks to be completed is available on [GitHub](http://ansiblecube.doc.bibliosansfrontieres.org).
